# ranmath
Math library by me. 

Will not be the most precise thing in the world but aiming to be within a reasonable amount of libc.

Aiming to be a single header stb-style library.

## How to use
Include ranmath.h in your project:
```
#include "ranmath.h"
```
or
```
#include <ranmath.h>
```
